- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage : 60-120 seconds
    - In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of a DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically swaps to a standby replica in another Availability Zone. (Assuming multi-az is enabled). 
    - Failover should typically take between 60-120 seconds though this is variable and will depend on the database activities. (e.g., a large transaction may result in an increase in failover time). 


- Minimum RTO for a single region outage : 15-60 mins
    - Should a region outage occur SRE staff will need to manually promote the read replica in the secondary/standby region to primary status. In the event that this event occurs off-hours we may assume that it will take 5-30 minutes for an SRE to be alerted and responsive and another 10-30 for the modification to undertaken (login, promotion of read replica, etc.)

- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage : 60-120 seconds
    - It will take (roughly) 60-120 seconds to failover to another AZ, so roughly 60-120 seconds of data would be lost..

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage: read-replica configuration dependent + RTO(roughly one hour). (4+ hours?)
    - If rds automation is enabled the RPO will be tied to the configuration. So, for example, if we've scheduled for 4 hours, minimum RPO would 4 hours + RTO - so, roughly 5 hours.
