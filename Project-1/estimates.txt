- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage : 60-120 seconds
    - In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of a DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically swaps to a standby replica in another Availability Zone. (Assuming multi-az is enabled). 
    - Failover should typically take between 60-120 seconds though this is variable and will depend on the database activities. (e.g., a large transaction may result in an increase in failover time). 


- Minimum RTO for a single region outage : 15-30 mins
    - Should a region outage occur SRE staff will need to manually promote the read replica in the secondary/standby region to primary status. In the event that this event occurs off-hours we may assume that it will take 5-15 minutes for an SRE to be alerted and responsive and another 10-15 for the modification to undertaken (login, promotion of read replica, etc.)

- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage : Instantaneous (0 downtime)
    - Multi-Az configurations provide a synchronous standby of the primary DB so we should expect no loss of data whatsoever.

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage : None 
    - A single region outage would present no issue as we have a read replica available in another region. 
    - No loss of data would be expected.
